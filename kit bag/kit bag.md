- incredibly useful so far
- two pockets on both the anterior and posteriot panel interior faces
- Dual dlastic webbing organizer on both anterior and posterior panel interior faces
    - Elastic is layerd with 8cm wide elasitc with 3 inch partitions, and 3cm wide elastic with 1.5 inch partitions
    - partitioning allows to find suitable size slot for most items
    - could maybe use a few 1.5/4 inch slots for very small items, e.g the last slot on the 3mm elasitc webbings

The usefulness of the PALS webbing on the anterior panel is questionable, at least I have not yet used it yet for anything other than my headlamp. But it does serve a parctical purpose in making the pack anterior panel more rigid. This is important when its carried in the sternum pack configuration, which allows you to open the pack 90 degrees into a kind of table. If the anterior panel is not rigid enough it will fold in on itself and the pack doesn't open the way it is supposed to.  

The anterior panel has a flat zipper pocket for quick access. I tend to keep a map in that pocket, as well as the webbing for the carry harness/shoulder strap when they are not being used.

The main pocket zipper zips all the way around to the bottom of the bag. This is so that when you are not wearing the bag you can put it on the ground and it opens up as a flat tray to give easy access to the contents. This configuration is very nice for example when cooking. Especially once it gets dark it's nice that all little items have their own for you to put them back where they belong.

There are three main ways to carry this pack

- standalone harness
- backpack harness
- shoulder bag
