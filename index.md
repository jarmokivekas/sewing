## [shoulder strap, 50mm webbing, with quick release](shoulder%20strap,%2050mm%20%20webbing,%20with%20quick%20release/shoulder%20strap,%2050mm%20webbing,%20with%20quick%20release.md)
shoulder straps, modular, webbing

Simple webbing-only shoulder straps for modular packs. Originally designed for  [backpack, daypack, large](backpack,%20daypack,%20large/backpack,%20daypack,%20large) but I've also used them for carrying large Ortelieb drybags, among other things.



## [shoulder harness, yolk](shoulder%20harness,%20yolk/shoulder%20harness,%20yolk)

The [shoulder harness, yolk](shoulder%20harness,%20yolk/shoulder%20harness,%20yolk) is inspired by a piece of equipment byHill People Gear. It's a single-piece shoulder harness that wraps around the back of the neck, spreading the carried weight over a large surface area. Features a light 5mm padding, Two types of backpack attachment points, buckles for load lifters, and PALS-style webbing at the front for attaching other modules or a sternum strap.

## belt, modular, pulk harness

- Originally cloned from a Jääkäri XL rucksack hip belt.
- I've found the curve on the belt to be unnecessary, and makes the PALS webbing not work as well as it could
    - make a less anatomic belt which is essentially just a long rectangle next time.
    - that would allow full use of PALS which is continuous along the intire length of the bels

## bikepack, handlebar

## chest kit bag



The [kit bag](kit%20bag/kit%20bag) is a pack that's meant to be carried high in the chest, attached to the front of a backpack houlder harness.

- Lots of elastic webbing and multiple compartments to keep small items organized
- main body large enough to carry hold bigger items
	- binoculars, books, water bottle

## mitten

- Toasty mittens with long cover over the forearm.
- The thumb works, but is a bit tricky to sew. It could use some improvement by using some other topology

## thermal cloak

Materials:

- Main fabric:
    - stong but thin waterproof, windproof, thermally reflective fabric
    - e.g. "Nylon Tarp Fabric, PU coated 70g/m2" from shelvy outdoor https://www.shelbyoutdoor.com/product_info.php?products_id=90
    - this is a non breathable coating, to make it more waterproof and durable than breathable membranes
- Zippers
    - zippers need to be separating
    - ideally with dual pull so they can be opened from both directions
    - 


### Thermal cloak size options

There are 3 main sizes of themal cloak that make most sense to me:

- 150cm x 150m
    - This is nice because you can use the full width of a normal 150cm wide fabric roll
    - All three zippers are also the same length.
    - you won't be able to use it as a sleeping bag cover, as it is not long enough to lie down in

- approx 110cm x 210
## tube scarf


## sleeping pad sleeve groundsheet

- inspired by Finnish defence forces sleeping pad by savotta
- PU coated Nylon fabric with high water column tolerance (10 000 mm)
- built-in elastic loop to keep the pad roolled up
- Allows inserting a foam sleeping pad (or two) inside a waterproof sleeve with extra "wings" to make the mat wider
- Wing don't provide insulation, but they are waterproof and act as a groundsheet to give more clean surface around the pad
- particularly useful for activites where you spend a lot of time on the ground without a tent.
- for cold weather, add an aluminum reflective mat in addition to a foam pad for extra warmth (kaira extreme, for example)
- use a simple thin pad in the summer when extra insulation is not needed

## sleeping bag liner

- e.g polarfleece
- 75 cm width if using regular 150 cm wide fabric
    - most are 90 cm wide, but sold as one size and also fit bigger people
- polar fleece weight 250 g/m^2 => 2 meter of fabric is 750g
    - mummy shape will reduce some of that weight
- attachment point for carinthia Defence or Tropen bag.
    - Tropen attachemnts
        - one on either side of the footbox (loop both inside and outside)
        - midway down the length of the sleeping bag on either sides. (loop on the inside, nothing on outside)
        - on either side at the shoulders. (loop inside, nothin on outside)
    - defence 4
        - 4 in the hood
        - either side half way down
        - either side of the foot footbox
        - one at the center of the footbox
        - all are loops
