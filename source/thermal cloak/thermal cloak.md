Materials:

- Main fabric:
    - strong but thin waterproof, windproof, thermally reflective fabric
    - e.g. "Nylon Tarp Fabric, PU coated 70g/m2" from shelvb outdoor https://www.shelbyoutdoor.com/product_info.php?products_id=90
    - this is a non breathable coating, to make it more waterproof and durable than breathable membranes

- Zippers
    - zippers need to be separating
    - ideally with dual pull so they can be opened from both directions
	- I didn't find ones that fit all my specifications , but these did the job:
	    - [1 meter](https://www.eurokangas.fi/vetoketju-8mm-hammas-avo-100cm-kahdella-vetimella-musta-m100-5600888m100)
	    -  [2 meter](https://www.eurokangas.fi/vetoketju-8mm-hammas-avo-200cm-kahdella-vetimella-musta-m100-5603751m100)
	- eurokangas is not a heavy gear-oriented shop, so these are not particularly high quality. and the only have pull tabs on one side.

### Thermal cloak size options

There are 3 main sizes of thermal cloak that make most sense to me:

- 150cm x 150m
    - This is nice because you can use the full width of a normal 150cm wide fabric roll
    - All three zippers are also the same length.
    - you won't be able to use it as a sleeping bag cover, as it is not long enough to lie down in

- approx 110cm x 210
