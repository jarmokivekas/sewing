# Sternum strap

A modular sternum strap that can be added to the shoulder harness of most backpacks. The sternum strap is attached using tri-glide buickles to either around the shoulder strap, or to a suitable piece of webbing of the shoulder strap.

This example is using 20mm webbing, but the width may be adjusted based on material preference.
