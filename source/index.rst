Outdoor equipment sewing instructions
=====================================

This website is a collection of various sewing patterns I've made over time for my own sewing projects.
If you keep browsing you'll find backpacks, PALS pouches, some camping related clothing and accessories, as well of some documentation on how I make these patterns.
It's all freely available for use as you best see fit. 

Completed pattern are listed on this page, as well as the side bar to the left. 

Below is a list of all the documented patterns so far. The undocumented ones are in the github repository that hosts this site: https://github.com/jarmokivekas/sewing/.
