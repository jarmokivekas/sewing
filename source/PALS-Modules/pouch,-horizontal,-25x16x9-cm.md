# Pouch, horizontal 25 x 16 x 9 cm



Nice relatively large pouch that work well for example as a side pouch on a ruck or even on a hip belt, albeit it's quite large on the hip.

The pattern below is for a 25x16x9 cm pouch. The pouch easily fits for example (not all the same time):

- binocluars
- water bottle and some snacks
- all you navigation equipment
- a rain jacket and pants
- an uninsulated [thermal cloak](../thermal-cloak/thermal-cloak)
- a fairly large tarp
- hammock + suspension
