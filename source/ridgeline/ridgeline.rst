Ridgeline System
----------------

A ridgeline system makes putting up a tarp or hammock office fast, easy, and reliably repeateble so it's set up the same way every time.

A hammock office, by the way, is when you set up a ridgeline above you hammock with a way to use it as your storage while in camp. Just hang out in your hammock, and all you essentials are within arms reach on the ridgeline.
That's what I call it, anyway...


Materials
---------

Paracord is relatively cheap and easily available. It works well enough, although it will stretch under load, so your ridgeline may sag just a bit in the morning.
Dyneema / Amsteel cord is another excellent choice. Amsteel will definitly not sag.
