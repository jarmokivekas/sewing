# Rain Poncho

This pattern doesn't actually exist yet. These are just notes for supplies, references, and design consideraions.

## Size

The poncho fabric should be at least 200 x 145 cm. For long people maybe closer to 250 x 150 cm.
A 210 - 215 cm length will drape roughly down to the knees when worn without a backpak. 
Wearing a backpak under the poncho will eat up some of the length on the rear side.

One option for a longer poncho would also be to make the rear section longer than the front section.
This way the backpak can take some of the length without issues.
A longer rear section will also probably not bother too much while walking even if you're not wearing a backpack, making the hem drape down lower.


My circumference around the upper arms and chest is roughly 140cm.
So the "body bag" configuration is a squeeze, especially with a sleeping bag.
The head end of the bag should be able to be left slightly open, similar to a backless camping quilt, to make space for the shoulders.
The leg end of the bag can be fully closed to make a foot box.

Some things to take into consideration if you want to close the poncho lengthwise into a "body bag" configuraion (200 cm x 70 cm) bag, or to attach two indentical ponchos together. 

- front-right and back-right closures need to match when wearing as a poncho
- front-right and front-left closures need to match when using in long-bag configuration
