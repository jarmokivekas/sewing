The patterns on this site use a specific way of naming pieces of a pattern and when talking about spatial aspects of a pattern that aims to be less ambiguous than just front, back, bottom, inside and out.

Many of the words are to be interpreted as they are defined as anatomical directions:

- posterior
- anterior
- superior
- inferior
- lateral
- distal
- medial
- proximal
