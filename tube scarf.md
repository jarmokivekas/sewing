Nothing much to this.

- 52cm x 52cm piece of fleece , wool fabric or something else cozy
- fold it in half, right sides facing together
- sew a seam to make it a tube
	-  if using a household sewing machine. set the zig-zag stitch width to 2mm, stitch width  5mm
	- make a small bar tack at both ends of the seam, or copious amounts of back tics
- the stretch of the fabric should be along the perimeter of the tube, not lengthwise
