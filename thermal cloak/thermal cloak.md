Materials:

- Main fabric:
    - strong but thin waterproof, windproof, thermally reflective fabric
    - e.g. "Nylon Tarp Fabric, PU coated 70g/m2" from shelvy outdoor https://www.shelbyoutdoor.com/product_info.php?products_id=90
    - this is a non breathable coating, to make it more waterproof and durable than breathable membranes
- Zippers
    - zippers need to be separating
    - ideally with dual pull so they can be opened from both directions


### Thermal cloak size options

There are 3 main sizes of thermal cloak that make most sense to me:

- 150cm x 150m
    - This is nice because you can use the full width of a normal 150cm wide fabric roll
    - All three zippers are also the same length.
    - you won't be able to use it as a sleeping bag cover, as it is not long enough to lie down in

- approx 110cm x 210
