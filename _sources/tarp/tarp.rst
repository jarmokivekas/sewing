Tarp Width
----------


The number of sections of fabric used for the tarp depend on the width of the tarp. 
Fabric comes in 1.5m wide rolls. So for every 1.5 meters of with, the tarp consturction adds
one more section of fabric. This means that the meterials needed for a 3meter wide tarp is much less than 
what is needed for a 3.2 meter tarp. As that extra 20 cm requires adding an entire 3rd section of fabric


The number of tie-off points
----------------------------

The tie-off points will be evenly spaced along each side of the tarp. With tie-offs in the corners, there is always at least two tie-off on each edge.
