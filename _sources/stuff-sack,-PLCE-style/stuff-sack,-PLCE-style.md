# Stuff Sack, PLCE Style 35x60cm


This is a pattern based on the british PLCE (Personal Load Carrying Equipment) rucksac side pouch insertsion bag, aptly named "*Bag, Insertion, Pouch, Side, Rucksack.*"

A stuff sack does not get much simpler than this. When laid flat, the bag is 60cm x 35cm in size. 

## Cut

The pattern is designed to take up exactly half of a 150cm wide length of fabric. So make two of these and you will not have any odd-shaped leftover fabric on your roll
