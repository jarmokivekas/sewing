# Backpack, daypack, large

## Patterns for all pieces

The pack is made from 4 main pieces:

- anterior panel: agains the wearers back, has the main exterior fabric and in internal pocket
- posterior panel: lots of PALS on the exterior face, two interior zipper pockets on the interior face
- intermediate panel: goes around the pack, stariting grom the bottom, going over the middles and back down the other side. This panel connects the anterior and posteiror panels
- inferior panel

Regarding reading the pattern, many of the directional terms are borrowed terms from medical anatomy, since I find they are less ambiguous in my opinoin. In case it's confusing, you'll be fine by translating as:

- inferior: bottom
- superior: top
- anterior: front
- posterior: back


## Finished piece

The length of the intermediate panel determined by clipping a measuring tape to the anterior panel template. 120 cm intermediate panel length is sligthly excessive, but can be cut afterward.

## Posterior panel

The posterior panel is

## Shoulder harness inferior anchor point

Make one for each shoulder strap.

Materials per each:

- Square piece of pack main fabric
- Webbing
- D-ring

**NOTE**: If would now design this again, I would change the length of the webbing to 10cm, and have it NOT extend out from the triangle. Otherwise threre is way too much in material in the seam when this gets inserted in the seam between the anterior and medial panel. It's 4 layers of codura from this triangle + 2 layers form the anterior panel + 2 layers form the exterior panel + 2 layers of webbing. So save some work and shorten the webbing to 10cm, and bartack it the this reinforcement triangle.

The _inferior section_ of the shoulder strap is connected to the pack with a steel D-ring.

- Fold the rectangular piece of fabric twice to make a triangle
- first fold made so wrong sides of the fabric face each other
- fold the length of webbing in half, leaving the D-ring in the fold
- insert the folded webbing into the second fold of the fabric

These triangles will be sewn into the seam between the anterior panel and medial panel. Both triangles are identical if you use D-ring. You you connect ladderlock buckles into these instead of D-ring, you need to make sure they are mirrored: the left and right anchor points have the buckle flipped. But in this case we use the D-ring, so both are identical.



## Posterior panel

The exterior face of the posterior panel has [Sewing PALS](../techiques/Sewing PALS) webbing, a patch of velcro loop, and the side release bulckle resptacles for the compression straps. You may also leave the compression strap buckles, and opt for a beavertail instead.

## Posterior panel main section

For the posterior panel main section, sew in the fuzzy velcro for morale paches and bartack all the PALS. For the PALS webbing, I recommend you start with bartacking at the center of the webbing, and the work your way out toward the ends of the webbing. That way you won't and up with any strange slack in your pals rows.
