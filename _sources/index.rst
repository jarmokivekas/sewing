   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


This website is a collection of various sewing patterns I've made over time for my own sewing projects.
If you keep browsing you'll find backpacks, PALS pouches, some camping related clothing and accessories, as well of some documentation on how I make these patterns.
It's all freely available for use as you best see fit. 

Completed pattern are listed on this page, as well as the side bar to the left. 

Night owl? You can switch between light and dark mode for this site in the top-right corner of the page. Else it defaults to your brower's theme settings.


Below is a list of all the documented patterns so far. The undocumented ones are in the github repository that hosts this site: https://github.com/jarmokivekas/sewing/.
