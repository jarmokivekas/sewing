2. place the *organizer section* on top of the *left pocket section*, wrong face of the *organizer section* facing the right face of the left pocket section.
3. match the bottom- and right-side edges of both sections
3. finish the right-side edge of the panel by making a folded hem.
4. divide the origanizer section into two or more small pockets by making a straight stitch vertically down the center of the section.

For the rigth pocket panel:

1. Finish the left-side edge of the *right pocket section* with a folded hem.

1. place both pocket panels on top of the *main panel*

The last step is to add the zipper and hanging loop the the pouch.
At the end of the zipper, the right face of the zipper is toward the main panel, while the wrong face of the zipper tape is toward the main panel while the zipper is going around the edges.
That is to say, in the 90 degree turn immediately following the beginning, and preceding the end, the face of the zipper gets flipped.
Match the edge of the zipper tape with the edge of the *main panel* when following around the edges.
