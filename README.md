Sewing designs, patterns, and resources



# Patterns & projects



## anorak

- WIP

## backpack, daypack, large

- Backpack with modular (detachable) shoulder straps
- PALS webbing on the posterior face and the sides.
- optionally PALS on the bottom panel (personally i find it very useful)

## belt, modular, pulk harness

- Originally cloned from a Jääkäri XL rucksack hip belt.
- I've found the curve on the belt to be unnecessary, and makes the PALS webbing not work as well as it could
    - make a less anatomic belt which is essentially just a long rectangle next time.
    - that would allow full use of PALS which is continuous along the intire length of the bels


## bikepack, handlebar

- WIP


## chest kit rig

- incredibly useful so far
- two pockets on both the anterior and posteriot panel interior faces
- Dual dlastic webbing organizer on both anterior and posterior panel interior faces
    - Elastic is layerd with 8cm wide elasitc with 3 inch partitions, and 3cm wide elastic with 1.5 inch partitions
    - partitioning allows to find suitable size slot for most items
    - could maybe use a few 1.5/4 inch slots for very small items, e.g the last slot on the 3mm elasitc webbings


This is one of my favourite pieces of gear I have sewn so far.

The usefulness of the PALS webbing on the anterior panel is questionable, at least I have not yet used it yet for anything other than my headlamp. But it does serve a parctical purpose in making the pack anterior panel more rigid. This is important when its carried in the sternum pack configuration, which allows you to open the pack 90 degrees into a kind of table. If the anterior panel is not rigid enough it will fold in on itself and the pack doesn't open the way it is supposed to.  

The anterior panel has a flat zipper pocket for quick access. I tend to keep a map in that pocket, as well as the webbing for the carry harness/shoulder strap when they are not being used.

The main pocket zipper zips all the way around to the bottom of the bag. This is so that when you are not wearing the bag you can put it on the ground and it opens up as a flat tray to give easy access to the contents. This configuration is very nice for example when cooking. Especially once it gets dark it's nice that all little items have their own for you to put them back where they belong.

There are three main ways to carry this pack

- standalone harness
- backpack harness
- shoulder bag

- The thumb works, but is a bit tricky to sew. It could use some improvement by using some other topology

## sleeping pad sleeve groundsheet

- inspired by Finnish defence forces sleeping pad by savotta
- PU coated Nylon fabric with high water column tolerance (10 000 mm)
- built-in elastic loop to keep the pad roolled up
- Allows inserting a foam sleeping pad (or two) inside a waterproof sleeve with extra "wings" to make the mat wider
- Wing don't provide insulation, but they are waterproof and act as a groundsheet to give more clean surface around the pad
- particularly useful for activites where you spend a lot of time on the ground without a tent.
- for cold weather, add an aluminum reflective mat in addition to a foam pad for extra warmth (kaira extreme, for example)
- use a simple thin pad in the summer when extra insulation is not needed
