Belt, modular, pulk harness

- Originally cloned from a Jääkäri XL rucksack hip belt.
- I've found the curve on the belt to be unnecessary, and makes the PALS webbing not work as well as it could
    - make a less anatomic belt which is essentially just a long rectangle next time.
    - that would allow full use of PALS which is continuous along the intire length of the bels

# PALS pouches

The patterns in this section are some of the PALS pouch modules I've made so far. As I've been using more of them, there are some systematic changes I would make to the patterns to fix some things I'd now consider mistakes. See the [Sewing PALS](techiques/Sewing%20PALS) page for more details on pouch design considerations, but the essential take-away is: maximize the are in the back of the pouch that has a solid PALS connection to the pack. So keep the top row as high up as possible, and the bottom row as low as possible, and design the pattern size in multiples of 1'' × 1.5'' rectangles. Many of the patterns here have approx 1cm of "padding" outside the PALS connection, which make the pouches floppier when attached to the pack.
## pouch, horizontal, 25x16x9 mm

- Nice relatively large pouch that work well for example as a side pouch on a hip belt
- This fits easily for example (not all the same time): binocluars. water bottle and some snacks, all your navigation equipment, a rain jacket and pants, an uninsulated thermal cloak, 3x3 meter tarp, hammock + suspension

## pouch, multitool / ice screw

A long and narrow pouch with a velcro flap enclosure. This pattern is originally for a 21 cm long ice screw, the kind climbers use to make a anchor point into a wall of ice. Those ice screw are also a brilliant tool for measuring ice thickness when moving on sea- or lake ice. This pouch is intended to be mounted in an easy-to-reach place to make measuring ice thickness more convenient, and therefore make the ice traversal safer. 


![](PALS%20Modules/pouch,%20multitool.svg)



## pouch, lidded, 2x3

- Mainly designed to fit a 1 litre water bottle, although I now prefer one that is 3 columns wide.

Simple one-seam Buff -style tube scarf


## [beanie](beanie/beanie)


![](beanie/beanie_g543.svg)


## [swiss army mitten.svg](mitten.svg)

- Toasty mittens with long cover over the forearm.
- The thumb works, but is a bit tricky to sew. It could use some improvement by using some other topology


## [anorak](anorak), [anorak.svg](anorak.svg)

Work in progress, probably won't be completed.

# Shelter equipment


## [hammock, 3.1 meters, channel gathered end](hammock,%203.1%20meters,%20channel%20gathered%20end.svg)

![thermal cloak](thermal%20cloak/thermal%20cloak.svg)



## BIvy bags

Many different alternatives for bivy bags. These are meant to be sewn in a waterproof breathable fabric. 

![bivy](bivy.svg)



## [sleeping pad sleeve with groundsheet](sleeping%20pad%20sleeve%20with%20groundsheet)


- inspired by Finnish defence forces sleeping pad by savotta
- PU coated Nylon fabric with high water column tolerance (10 000 mm)
- built-in elastic loop to keep the pad roolled up
- Allows inserting a foam sleeping pad (or two) inside a waterproof sleeve with extra "wings" to make the mat wider
- Wing don't provide insulation, but they are waterproof and act as a groundsheet to give more clean surface around the pad
- particularly useful for activites where you spend a lot of time on the ground without a tent.
- for cold weather, add an aluminum reflective mat in addition to a foam pad for extra warmth (kaira extreme, for example)
- use a simple thin pad in the summer when extra insulation is not needed



## [sleeping bag liner](sleeping%20bag%20liner)

- e.g polarfleece
	- on later thought, fleece compresses poorly and it turns out to be very bulky is made with polarfleece
- 75 cm width if using regular 150 cm wide fabric
	- most are 90 cm wide, but sold as one size and also fit bigger people
- polar fleece weight 250 g/m^2 => 2 meter of fabric is 750g
	- mummy shape will reduce some of that weight
- attachment point for carinthia Defence or Tropen bag.
	- Tropen attachemnts
		- one on either side of the footbox (loop both inside and outside)
		- midway down the length of the sleeping bag on either sides. (loop on the inside, nothing on outside)
		- on either side at the shoulders. (loop inside, nothin on outside)
	- defence 4
		- 4 in the hood
		- either side half way down
		- either side of the foot footbox
		- one at the center of the footbox
		- all are loops
