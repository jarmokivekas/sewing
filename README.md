Belt, modular, pulk harness

- Originally cloned from a Jääkäri XL rucksack hip belt.
- I've found the curve on the belt to be unnecessary, and makes the PALS webbing not work as well as it could
    - make a less anatomic belt which is essentially just a long rectangle next time.
    - that would allow full use of PALS which is continuous along the intire length of the bels
    -

[sleeping pad sleeve with groundsheet](sleeping%20pad%20sleeve%20with%20groundsheet)


- inspired by Finnish defence forces sleeping pad by savotta
- PU coated Nylon fabric with high water column tolerance (10 000 mm)
- built-in elastic loop to keep the pad roolled up
- Allows inserting a foam sleeping pad (or two) inside a waterproof sleeve with extra "wings" to make the mat wider
- Wing don't provide insulation, but they are waterproof and act as a groundsheet to give more clean surface around the pad
- particularly useful for activites where you spend a lot of time on the ground without a tent.
- for cold weather, add an aluminum reflective mat in addition to a foam pad for extra warmth (kaira extreme, for example)
- use a simple thin pad in the summer when extra insulation is not needed

[sleeping bag liner](sleeping%20bag%20liner)

- e.g polarfleece
	- on later thought, fleece compresses poorly and it turns out to be very bulky is made with polarfleece
- 75 cm width if using regular 150 cm wide fabric
	- most are 90 cm wide, but sold as one size and also fit bigger people
- polar fleece weight 250 g/m^2 => 2 meter of fabric is 750g
	- mummy shape will reduce some of that weight
- attachment point for carinthia Defence or Tropen bag.
	- Tropen attachemnts
		- one on either side of the footbox (loop both inside and outside)
		- midway down the length of the sleeping bag on either sides. (loop on the inside, nothing on outside)
		- on either side at the shoulders. (loop inside, nothin on outside)
	- defence 4
		- 4 in the hood
		- either side half way down
		- either side of the foot footbox
